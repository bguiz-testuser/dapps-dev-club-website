The DApps Dev Club is currently looking for sponsors!

## Venue

Ideally we need a venue that can host all ten of our sessions (they run twice per month). It needs to be reasonably central, have WiFi, and have a projector.

## Food and Beverage

Our sessions will run after work hours on weekdays, and we don't want to go hungry/ thirsty while learning and building.

## What's in it for you?

There is a spot on this page with your name and logo on it!

Of course, it is not just that - developers are a scarce resource, and hard to hire for. The DApps Dev Club is attended by developers and aspiring developers. Now you connect the dots! ðŸ˜‰

If you have space to spare in your office, or can take on the F&B tab, please get in touch with [@bguiz](https://twitter.com/bguiz).
