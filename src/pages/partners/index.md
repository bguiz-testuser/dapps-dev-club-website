The DApps Dev Club is currently looking for partners!

## Venue

Many thanks to [Microsoft](https://microsoft.com/) for providing their excellent venue for our **kickoff session**.

[Chainstack](https://chainstack.com/) for providing their excellent venue once per month. All of our **even-numbered sessions** are now covered!

~~Ideally we need a venue that can host all ten of our sessions (they run twice per month). It needs to be reasonably central, have WiFi, and have a projector.~~

We're *still looking* for venues for our **remaining odd-numbered sessions**.

## Food and Beverage

Our sessions will run after work hours on weekdays, and we don't want to go hungry/ thirsty while learning and building.

Thanks very much to  [Microsoft](https://microsoft.com/) for sponsoring our F&amp;B for our **kickoff session**.

We're *still looking* for F&amp;B for our **remaining sessions**.

## Community outreach

[Spartan Group](https://www.spartangroup.io/) - a big thanks to Melody, Casper, and Gavin from Spartan for helping us to connect with the right people from the community.

[NBC'19](https://www.globaltechchallenge.com/) - a big thanks to Wing from NBC'19 for helping out with the AV recording, and the graphic designs.

[Blockchain & DApps meetup](https://www.meetup.com/BlockChain-Dapps-Technology/) - a big thanks to Kenneth (yes, the same Kenneth who's running this running DApps Dev Club) for outreach via his meetup group.

[StartupToken Singapore meetup](https://www.meetup.com/StartupTokenSingapore/) - a big thanks to Yacine for outreach via his meetup group, and his [telegram group](https://t.me/startuptoken).

## Audio Visual

Sometimes you genuinely cannot make it to a session IRL -
last-minute stuff crops up, life gets in the way, we get it!

That's why we'd like to make sure you can have a way for you to catch up on a session that you missed, by recording them.

A big thanks to EngineersSG, for their excellent
[DIY tech meetup recording guide](https://github.com/engineersftw/gitwiki).
Especially [Michael Cheng](http://coderkungfu.com/)
for answering all of our questions, and helping to troubleshoot our set up.

## What's in it for you?

There's a spot on this page with your name and logo on it!

Also, we'll interview you to announce our partnership, and you that's an opportunity to showcase what you do. Check out our existing [partnership accouncements](/tags/partnership/).

Of course, it isn't just that - developers are a scarce resource, and hard to hire for. The DApps Dev Club is attended by developers + aspiring developers. Now you connect the dots! ðŸ˜‰

If you have space to spare in your office, can take on the F&amp;B tab, have a community to broadcast to, or help out with AV, please get in touch with [@bguiz](https://twitter.com/bguiz), or [on our discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/eM9Vv7P).
