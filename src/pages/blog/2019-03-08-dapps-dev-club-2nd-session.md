DApps Dev Club will be holding its second session, **Technical overview**, on Tuesday.

The topics that we will be covering: The Ethereum Virtual Machine, Smart Contracts, and Web3.

<!-- excerpt -->

## Format

As promised in the [kickoff session](https://dappsdev.org/blog/2018-02-25-dapps-dev-club-kickoff-session/),
future sessions will be less of us talking/ presenting -
and transition towards a more discussion and hands on type session.

In this session, we will not be delving into the code yet. But we will get our first glimpse of Solidity!

Read select parts of the [*Mastering Ethereum*](https://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook) book, which we'll be discussing in the next session:
  - Chapter 1: What is Ethereum
    - Optional: *Ethereumâ€™s Four Stages of Development*
    - Optional: *The Birth of Ethereum*
    - Optional: *Ethereumâ€™s Development Culture*
    - Read all of the sections in this chapter, except for these ones above, as we do not plan to discuss them in the next session.
    - If you only have time to read *one* section, read: *Ethereum and Turing Completeness*
  - Chapter 13: The Ethereum Virtual Machine
    - Optional: Compiling Solidity to EVM Bytecode
    - Optional: Contract Deployment Code
    - Optional: Disassembling the Bytecode
    - Read all of the sections in this chapter, except for these ones above, as we do not plan to discuss them in the next session.
    - If you only have time to read *one* section, read: *Turing Completeness and Gas*

If you don't have time to read any of this at all, don't worry, you can still come along. You will get more out of it if you do though!
