We held our 4th session - on Solidity - a few days ago, on Tuesday evening at
Chainstack. We covered features of Solidity as a programming language, as well
as a few development tools used to work with Solidity - solc, truffle, and ganache.

We've previously posted a [round up summary](/blog/2019-04-12-dapps-dev-club-4th-session-roundup/) about the session. This post is about the videos that we have recorded during the session.

## Thanks

A big thanks to Zi Hui &amp; [Wing](https://www.thegeekwing.com/) for helping with the recordings,
to [Ashlie](https://www.ashliechin.com/) from
[Chainstack](https://chainstack.com/), and Dennis from
[Acronis](https://www.acronis.com/)

and to Ashlie from
[BitTemple](https://bittemple.io/)
for setting up the venue.

Also thanks to EngineersSG, especially
[Michael Cheng](http://coderkungfu.com),
for their excellent
[DIY tech meetup recording guide](https://github.com/engineersftw/gitwiki)
without which we would probably have no recordings!

## News

All of our sessions are now available on
[Engineers.SG](https://www.engineers.sg/)!

For those of you who have not heard of them before:

> Engineers.SG is a not-for-profit community initiative created to help document
> the Singapore tech and startup scene.
>
> Created to answer the question, "where are the engineers in Singapore?",
> Engineers.SG seeks to be the place for anyone to get to know, learn and
> interact with the Singapore tech community. On the site, you can find a
> curated list of videos recording of local tech meetups and events.

Chances are, if you go to a tech meetup in Singapore, and it is being recorded,
the Engineers.SG crew is behind it. We're stoked to be on board with them!

## Reflections

AV is an area in which we started this series off with close to zero expertise,
and we have been constantly learning.

Our journey so far:

When we recorded the first session, we
found that the video framerate was very low, to the point that it was choppy,
and we managed to figure out what was causing that and fix it in time for
the second session. However, the volume that was recorded was unusually low,
and the recorded videos were barely audible. We weren't able to fix this
in post-processing without a lot of noise and distortions, and this problem persisted in both sessions 2 and 3.

However, in time for session 4, we managed to work out how to record at a
higher volume, without picking up too much background noise, and thus were able
to adjust the volume levels in post processing. The quality of the videos that
have we have for this session are the best that we have had to date,
and quite frankly *good enough*. So in remaining sessions, we aim to maintain
this quality that we have achieved.

Thanks to
[Michael Cheng](http://coderkungfu.com/) of
[Engineers.SG](https://www.engineers.sg/)
for his help with figuring out the post-processing. In particular,
the Engineers.SG git wiki - which we have already been using as a reference for
our hardware purchase and connection set ups - also happens to contain some
[handy scripts](https://github.com/engineersftw/gitwiki/tree/master/scripts)
which we used to do things better this time around.

Thanks to Dennis from
[Acronis](https://acronis.com)
for his hands-on support in helping out with adjusting the
settings and connection configuration for the audio that allowed the recorded
audio to have a **much better** signal-to-noise ratio than we had previously
achieved.

## Next session
