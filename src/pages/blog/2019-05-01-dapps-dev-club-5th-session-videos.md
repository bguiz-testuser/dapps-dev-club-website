We held our 5th session - on testing smart contracts - yesterday,
on Tuesday evening at BitTemple.
We built upon the example contract from Session #04,
by writing some tests to ensure that it behaves as it should.
But **before** delving right into testing smart contracts with truffle,
we spent a bit of time exploring what software testing is,
and writing good old Javascript tests, using Mocha.

More on that ~~later, when we get the round up summary post out!~~ here,
in our [round up post for this session](/blog/2019-05-02-dapps-dev-club-5th-session-roundup/ "Round up of DApps Dev Club Session #05 on Testing"),
which does a summary/ recap of what went on.

## Thanks

A big thanks to [Wing](https://www.thegeekwing.com/) for helping with the recordings,
to Solomon from
[BitTemple](https://bittemple.io/)
for coordinating and setting up the venue.

Also thanks to EngineersSG, especially
[Michael Cheng](http://coderkungfu.com),
for their excellent
[DIY tech meetup recording guide](https://github.com/engineersftw/gitwiki)
without which we would probably have no recordings!

## News

As mentioned in our video post for session #04,
all of our videos are now available on Engineers.SG!

## Reflections

Cobbling together the images and creating the banner image for these
posts has thus far been a manual process,
and thus **extremely** time consuming.

I have been putting off writing a script to automate this,
using this as an excuse:

[![XKDC: Automation](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/automation.png)](https://xkcd.com/1319/ "'Automating' comes from the roots 'auto-' meaning 'self-', and 'mating', meaning 'screwing'.")

&hellip; but *finally* recognised procrastination for what it was,
and bit the bullet, and went ahead and wrote one -
will be adding that to
[our github organisation](https://github.com/dapps-dev-club)
once it has been cleaned up
(it is simply too scrappy at the moment ðŸ˜Š).

## Next session

RSVPs are now open for our *next* session -
please let us know if you're attending,
as it helps us plan for seating, ordering F&amp;B, etc:

[**RSVP** on eventbrite](https://dappsdev-s01e06.eventbrite.com/)

See you all again soon! ðŸ¤˜
