DApps Dev Club is holding its 5th session, about testing smart contracts,
on ~~Tuesday, 23rd April~~ Tuesday, 30th April.
Note that this event has been postponed by a week from
the originally scheduled date.

[**RSVP now!**](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/60041615087)

Here's what you need to know!

<!-- excerpt -->

## Event

The session will be held at
[BitTemple's](https://bittemple.io/)
office in Raffles Place.

Thanks Solomon for helping us run the event!

## Topic

In our previous session, we wrote smart contracts in Solidity, and used truffle
to deploy them to a local blockchain. In this session we will be continuing to
use truffle, but this time using its *test runner* capabilities.

We will learn how to write tests in Mocha (which truffle's test runner wraps
around), specifically to:

- test state machines
- test data storage
- test events
- mock smart contracts

As with the previous session, there will be hands on parts, so please bring
along your laptops!

## Preparation

A basic level of Javascript *will be required* for this session, as we will be
using it during the session. Here are some recommendations on where to learn Javascript.

- [scrimba](https://scrimba.com/g/gintrotojavascript)
- [exercism.io](https://exercism.io/)
- [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)

(arranged in order, from lowest to highest time commitment required.)

The reason for this is that we will be writing tests for our smart contracts in Javascript, not Solidity.

So if you're **not familiar** with Javascript, or need a refresher, please make
use of one of the resources above, and get up to speed. You need not feel
daunted though, as we have enlisted the *help of some volunteers* from the [SingaporeJS community](https://www.meetup.com/Singapore-JS/),
as well as the broader developer community here, who are
familiar with Javascript, in order to help you all out during the session.

Once (re)acquainted with Javascript, the next thing to do as preparation would
be to get acquainted with
[Mocha](https://mochajs.org/). We will be using truffle's test runner, which
is a wrapper around Mocha with some additional stuff that is specific to smart
contracts. That additional stuff will be the focus of the session, so it would
be beneficial to get familiar to the base layer of Mocha before getting deeper
into it.

The [Mocha getting started guide](https://mochajs.org/#getting-started)
is excellent, and should not take longer than ten minutes to get through,
so give that a whir!

## Next session

&hellip; it helps us plan for seating, ordering F&amp;B, et cetera.

See you all again soon!
