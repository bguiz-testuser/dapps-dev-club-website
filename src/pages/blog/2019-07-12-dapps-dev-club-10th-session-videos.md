We held our 10th session - the **Finale** - earlier this week, at Chainstack.

This session featured three **guest speakers**.

is already out, and has you covered for all the details.

## Reflections

The audio quality for this session appears to be much better than the previous sessions,
although I am not exactly sure what has changed that made the difference.
My AV skills clearly are very much in the "don't know what I don't know"
stage at the moment.

There was a brief glitch in the second video (featuring Thomas),
that needed to be cut out at around the 08:30 mark,
but nothing important occurred then -
just the transition period while swapping from slide deck to demo video -
so that worked out well!

## Sessions 7, 8, 9

On a more general note, I have yet to upload the videos from sessions
seven, eight, and nine.
A few of you have been - sometimes anxiously ðŸ˜¬ -
asking whether they have been recorded.

The answer is **yes** they have indeed been recorded,
and the plan is to upload them as soon as time permits!

## Next season
