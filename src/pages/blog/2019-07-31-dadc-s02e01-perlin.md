DApps Dev Club is holding special edition session with Perlin,
on Tuesday, 6th August.
You will learn how to build a DApp using Perlin Wavelet
using less than 100 lines of code,
and will be conducted by
[Kenta](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dranithix/),
Perlin's CTO, and co-founder!

[**RSVP now!**](http://bit.ly/dadc-21-perlin)

Here's what you need to know!

<!-- excerpt -->

## Event

The session will be held at
[Chainstack's](https://chainstack.com/)
office in Suntec City.

Thanks Ashlie for helping us run the event!

Note that we'll be starting slightly earlier than usual -
at 6:00pm instead of 6:30pm.

## Topics

We will have the usual DApps Dev Club introduction,
for those of you coming for your first session.

Kenta will be doing the heavy lifting though - 
he will show us just how easy it is to
develop and deploy a decentralised application
on the Perlin network, and using their Wavelet platform.
We will build a chat DApp using &lt;100 lines of code.

## Preparation

Bring your laptops, with NodeJs v10 or later,
and any code editor that supports Typescript
(e.g. IntelliJ, WebStorm or VS Code).

If you are extra keen, check out the following resources as well:

- [AssemblyScript](https://github.com/AssemblyScript/assemblyscript)
- [Rust version of this workshop](http://bit.ly/dadc-perlin-chat)

Note that we will **not** be using Rust in this workshop ðŸ˜….

If you have any questions, please ask away in our
[chat group](http://bit.ly/dadc-chat "DApps Dev club chat group").
We also have a brand new [Telegram announcements channel](http://bit.ly/dadc-announce "DApps Dev club announcements channel").

## Next session

[**RSVP** on eventbrite](http://bit.ly/dadc-21-perlin)

&hellip; it helps us plan for seating, ordering F&amp;B, et cetera.

See you all again soon!
