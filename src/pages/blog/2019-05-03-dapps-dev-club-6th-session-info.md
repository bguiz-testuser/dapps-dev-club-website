DApps Dev Club is holding its 6th session,
about front end development using web3.js,
on Tuesday, 14th May.

[**RSVP now!**](https://dappsdev-s01e06.eventbrite.com/)

Here's what you need to know!

<!-- excerpt -->

## Event

The session will be held at Chainstack's office in Suntec City.

Thanks [Ashlie](https://www.ashliechin.com/) for helping us run the event!

## Topic

In our previous sessions, we have been focussed very much on smart contracts,
and have done *very little* to do with with
the **other** big area in DApp development: The client.

For this session, we will focus on writing a client application for
smart contracts as a web application, using **web3.js**.
Those of you who have been following along doing the hands-on parts
in our sessions, you would have already used some parts of web3.js
in a different context.


Specifically, we will cover:

- Call and send
- Payable functions
- Gas estimation
- Event listening
- Transaction signing

As with the previous session, there will be hands on parts, so please bring
along your laptops!

## Preparation

A basic level of Javascript *will be required* for this session, as we will be
using it during the session. Here are some recommendations on where to learn Javascript.

- [scrimba](https://scrimba.com/g/gintrotojavascript)
- [exercism.io](https://exercism.io/)
- [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)

(arranged in order, from lowest to highest time commitment required.)

The reason for this is that we will be writing tests for our smart contracts in Javascript, not Solidity.

So if you're **not familiar** with Javascript, or need a refresher, please make
use of one of the resources above, and get up to speed. You need not feel
daunted though, as we have enlisted the *help of some volunteers* from the [SingaporeJS community](https://www.meetup.com/Singapore-JS/),
as well as the broader developer community here, who are
familiar with Javascript, in order to help you all out during the session.

## Set up

Apart from learning (or refreshing) your Javascript skills,
there is also some software that needs to be set up,
in order to follow along with the hands-on parts of the session.

- [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)
- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/)
- [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/)
- [solc](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.5.7/installing-solidity.html)
- [truffle](https://truffleframework.com/docs/truffle/getting-started/installation)
- [ganache](https://truffleframework.com/docs/ganache/quickstart)

(You would already have these installed if you've been following along with
our previous sessions!)

Only one new tool needs to be installed, a static file HTTP server:

```bash
npm install --global http-server
```

## Next session

[**RSVP** on eventbrite](https://dappsdev-s01e06.eventbrite.com/)

See you all again soon!
