DApps Dev Club is holding its 8th session, about smart contract security,
on Tuesday, 11th June.

[**RSVP now!**](https://dappsdev-s01e08.eventbrite.com/)

Here's what you need to know!

<!-- excerpt -->

## Event

The session will be held at
[Chainstack's](https://chainstack.com/)
office in Suntec City.

Thanks Ashlie for helping us run the event!

## Topics

We have yet to put up the round up post or videos from the previous session -
sorry about that -
things are getting pretty busy around here, especially with
[NBC'19](https://nbc.devpost.com)
around the corner!

Fortunately, this session does not lean on any material covered in the
previous session, but rather presents some completely new material.

Specifically, for this session, what we have lined up:

- IPFS basics
- Extending limited smart contract storage via IPFS

## Preparation

For this session, the main preparation that you will need to do is to
[install IPFS](https://docs.ipfs.io/guides/guides/install/).

## Projects

In the previous sessions, a few of you did say that you felt you were
ready to start developing your own DApps,
and asked for some project ideas to work on.
We're stoked!

&hellip; for those who are interested, please take your ideas to our
[chat group](https://bit.ly/dadc-chat),
or come and talk with us during the session -
we have a few interesting ones for you to tackle!

## Next session

[**RSVP** on eventbrite](https://dappsdev-s01e08.eventbrite.com/)

&hellip; it helps us plan for seating, ordering F&amp;B, et cetera.

See you all again soon!
