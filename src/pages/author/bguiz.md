Brendan organises the DApps Dev Club.

He blogs at [bguiz.com](http://blog.bguiz.com), tweets at [@bguiz](https://twitter.com/bguiz), and
pushes commits at [github](https://github.com/bguiz). He is a professional rearranger of 1's and
0's, and uses Javascript to do this for the most part. He works as a Senior Software Engineer at
Autopilot.

He decided to start DApps Dev Club after finding that the blockchain related tech meetups here were
mostly focused on promoting tokens and protocols; and felt that there was a need for something that
was more focused on the underlying technology, and development of decentralised applications.
