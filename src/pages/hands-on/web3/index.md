## Recap

We are building upon a truffle project that we previously completed.
In this project thus far, we have:

- Written a smart contract
- Deployed the smart contract to a (simulated) blockchain running locally
- Written tests for our smart contracts

You **will not** be able to follow along in this hands on,
if you have not got a copy of this project.
For this, you have two options:

- **Recommended**: Follow along with the hands-on exercises completed
  previously.
  - This is recommended, because you will have built the project on your own,
    and you will better understand the different working parts of the system
    that you are interacting with
- **Bare minimum**: Clone the
  [git repository](https://github.com/dapps-dev-club/dadc-cars)
  for this project, then delete the `app` directory (`rm -rf ./app`)
  - Do this, only if you are short of time, and want to start right away.
