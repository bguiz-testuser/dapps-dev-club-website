## Project set up

Open your terminal, and enter the following commands to set up a new project.

```bash
mkdir mocha-hands-on
cd mocha-hands-on/
git init
echo "/node_modules" >> .gitignore
```

Now that we have set up our project folder, we can install Mocha, our
test runner. We install it as a development dependency on this project:

```bash
npm i --save-dev mocha
```

Next, let's make this project folder a NodeJs project, in order to manage it
using `npm` tools.

When you run `npm init`, you will be prompted to do enter various values to
initialise your `package.json` file with.
The text in parentheses indicates the default value that will be used.
For example: `package name: (mocha-hands-on)` means that the package name
will be set to `mocha-hands-on` if you just hit `Enter` without typing anything.

Here are the values that we have used:

```
$ npm init
package name: (mocha-hands-on)
version: (1.0.0) 0.0.0
description: Mocha Hands-on for DApps Dev Club
entry point: (index.js)
test command: (mocha) mocha './**/*.spec.js'
git repository: dapps-dev-club/mocha-hands-on
keywords: mocha, hands-on, dapps-dev-club
author: bguiz
license: (ISC) GPL-3.0
```

The most important thing is that the test command must be entered exactly
as `mocha './**/*.spec.js'`.

## Version control with git

Now we have completed our set up, we **strongly recommend** that you do
a `git commit` at this point, before moving on to the next steps,
so that you can revert to this known point easily if need be.

```bash
git add package.json .gitignore
git commit -m "initialise project"
```

Optionally, you may wish to push your project to github:

Create a new repository on github. To do this, go to your profile (or
organisation page, if you have one), and click on the **New** button.

Alternatively, you may click on the `+` icon in the top-right corner.

![Create a new repository on github](./github-new-repo-profile.png)

Next, enter some details about your repository.

- Set the name to `mocha-hands-on`.
- Set the description to `Mocha Hands-on for DApps Dev Club`.
- Check that the visibility is **Public** (should be selected already as the default).
- Do not select any of the repository initialisation options,
  as we do not need any of them.
- Click on **Create repository**.

![Enter details about your repository](./github-new-repo-details.png)

This should create the repository on Github, but it is empty.
What you are interested in is the ***git remote address***.
Copy the command that starts with `git remote add`.

![Copy the git remote add command after the repository has been created on github](./github-new-repo-push.png)

Paste that command into your terminal, then take a look that it has been added:

```bash
$ git remote add origin git@github.com:dapps-dev-club/mocha-hands-on.git
$ git remote -v
origin	git@github.com:dapps-dev-club/mocha-hands-on.git (fetch)
origin	git@github.com:dapps-dev-club/mocha-hands-on.git (push)
```

Now you can finally push your repository to the remote hosted on Github.

```bash
git push origin master
```

## Write some code

Next let's create an implementation file,
and a corresponding specification file:

```bash
touch feature1.js # implementation
touch feature1.spec.js # specification
```

Open your code editor of choice, and edit these files.

### Implementation

For the implementation, we're going to have a very simple addition function.

```javascript
// system under test: feature1

function add(x, y) {
  return x + y;
}

module.exports = {
  add,
};
```

### Specification

Next we write specifications that the test runner (mocha), will use to test
our implementation.

First, let's set up some basic structure.
We will import `assert` from NodeJs core,
and import `add` which is the feature that we implemented earlier.
Then we create some `describe` blocks to group tests together.

```javascript
// tests for: feature1

const assert = require('assert');

const { add } = require('./feature1.js');

describe('feature1', () => {

  describe('add', () => {

    // tests go here

  });

});
```

Next, let's add a test for specific known values -
we all know what one plus two equals:

```javascript
    it('works with specific values', () => {
      // specific known values
      const result = add(1, 2);
      assert.equal(result, 3);
    });
```

Put this test inside your inner `describe` block.
The hierarchy should look like `describe -> describe -> it` at the moment.

## Running your tests

```bash
npm run test
```

You should see that the test passes.

Now it's time to experiment:

- Change the code in your implementation such that it returns the
  **wrong result**
  - Run the tests again
  - This is a **bug** in the **implementation**
- Now revert to the original implementation, and change the code in your test,
  such that it has a **wrong assertion**
  - Run the tests again
  - This is **bug** in the **specification**
- Now, without reverting to the original specification, change the code in
  your implementation such that it returns a **wrong result** as well.
  - Run the tests again
  - This is a **false positive** and indicative of bugs - or omissions - in
    both the implementation and and the specification
- Now revert the implementation and the specification to their original code
  - Run the tests again
  - ðŸ˜… back to passing tests
  - This is what you should ideally have

## Write more tests

Next, let's test that our `add` function conforms to some mathematical laws:

A test for commutativity:

```javascript
    it('is commutative', () => {
      // a + b = b + a
      const leftHandSide = add(15, 99);
      const rightHandSide = add(99, 15);
      assert.equal(leftHandSide, rightHandSide);
    });
```

A test for associativity:

```javascript
    it('is associative', () => {
      // (a + b) + c = a + (b + c)
      const leftHandSide = add(add(15, 99), 890);
      const rightHandSide = add(15, add(99, 890));
      assert.equal(leftHandSide, rightHandSide);
    });
```

## Help, I'm stuck!

For those of you who have gotten stuck at some point, here's a reference
copy of the repository for you to clone:

[github.com/dapps-dev-club/mocha-hands-on](https://github.com/dapps-dev-club/mocha-hands-on)

To optimise for learning, **do not** delete the current copy of your attempt -
instead keep that as it is, and clone this reference copy to
**another folder**.
Then compare them side-by-side, and work out what the differences are.

Next go to [our chat](https://bit.do/dadc-chat) and ping us with what you've
found out, as it might help others who have done something similar in their
own attempts.

## Property based testing

This is a **stretch goal** that is **not required** for this session, catered to
those of you who have already worked with Mocha before, and are already
twiddling your thumbs!

### Reading material

About using property based testing (sometimes AKA generative testing)

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuickCheck
- http://hypothesis.works/articles/what-is-property-based-testing/
- http://www.lihaoyi.com/post/PrinciplesofAutomatedTesting.html
- https://github.com/leebyron/testcheck-js/tree/master/integrations/mocha-testcheck
- https://github.com/bguiz/jest-property-testing-demo

### Tasks

- Use `mocha-testcheck` to write property based tests runnable by mocha
- Write these tests in a new file named `feature1.gen.spec.js`
- Copy existing tests, and convert them to be property based
- Run the tests

```bash
npm install --save-dev mocha-testcheck
touch feature1.gen.spec.js
npm run test
```

Hints:

- Use `gen.int` at first, then switch to `gen.number`
- What happens when you run the tests now?
- Where does this indicate on the implementation and specification
  correctness quadrants?
