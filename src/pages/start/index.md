The Distributed Apps Development club is a small group of people who meet regularly - twice a month - think book club meets tech meetup.

The goal is to collaboratively develop a DApp (distributed app) together, learn a lot of new skills, and have fun in the process.

Get in touch with us online on [discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/RTup7Ba), or better still, meet us IRL at the [next session](/sessions)
