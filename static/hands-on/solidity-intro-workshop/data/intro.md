We are going to introduce the fundamental features of Solidity as a programming language:

- smart contract structure
- primitive types
- dynamic types
- functions
- function modifiers
- events

There is a lot more to it Solidity than that, this lesson aims to be an introduction to the language.

Please copy the solidity file in the panel right above this one, into Remix, which is on the right hand side. Apologies for the dark background in the above panel.

Once in Remix, hit `Ctrl+S` or `Cmd+S`, and check that it compiles OK. You may wish to collapse the panes at the sides within Remix if things are too squeezy.
