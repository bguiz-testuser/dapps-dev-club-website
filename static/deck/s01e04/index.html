# Decentralised Applications Development Club

![DApps Dev Club](https://dappsdev.org/img/dadc-logo.png)

## Solidity

09/04/2019

???

- The title for tonight's session is "Solidity", but we'll be doing
  more than that
- We'll also be covering the different tools used when developing solidity
- And we'll also have a guest speaker joining us later in the session?
- Mean while, I'd like everyone to scan this QR code, or type out that
  shortened URL - bit.do/dadc-s01e04 - that will open up the same slide deck
  that I am presenting from on your computers, and this will be essential to
  do and follow along, because there are going to be a lot of links to follow
- in the previous session, we wasted quite a bit of time communicating the URLs
  so this time, we're going to not do that. grab this link now, or get it from
  our discord

- [truffle](https://truffleframework.com/docs/truffle/getting-started/installation)
- [ganache](https://truffleframework.com/docs/ganache/quickstart)

???

- So in the previous session, I asked all of you to install a bunch of stuff
- and here's that list again
- can I have a show of hands, for how many have actually installed all of these
  things?
- ok so for the rest, did any of you encounter any issues while trying to
  install it?
- and if you haven't quite gotten around to it yet, well let's get that out of
  the way before we start, while we're waiting for people to trickle in, might
  as well put the time to good use
- ok so if anyone here has had trouble installing node, solc, truffle, or
  ganache, please raise your hands, and I'll try my best to help you to
  troubleshoot in the next few minutes

- Decentralised Applications Development Club
- Format inspired by the technical book club from SingaporeJS

]

???

- The DApps Dev Club meets twice a month, and this is our 4th session
  - In each session, we plan to discuss about 3 or four different topics,
   selected from the *Mastering Ethereum* book
- We are a technical book club, so in each session, when we meet up together,
  we'll be discussing select parts from this book, plus working through things
  together
  - I should mention that while this is not a common format, it isn't completely
    new - in fact it is inspired by the book club that the SingaporeJS meetup
    runs
  - In the first couple of sessions, it was mostly me talking, but the rest of
    the sessions are going to be hands-on

- So, how about you? These sessions are designed with a particular audience in
  mind.
- If you know nothing about blockchain, or about smart contracts, that's perfect
- However, if you don't know some basic JS, you'll need to pick that up to follow along in the later sessions.
  - I've already posted some resources that you can use to learn JS - it's in
    the latest post on dappsdev.org now,
    or come talk to me, or ask around in our discord
- Bring your laptops to the sessions, as you'll be able to participate in the
  hands on parts of the sessions

???

- I think most of us by now have encountered someone on a Telegram group, who
  joins, and within seconds says "wen ico? wen moon?" (with that exact spelling)
- If you're that person, these sessions are not for you. We're *not* going
  to be building an ERC20, or learning how to trade or speculate on them.
- What we're about here is focussed on developing decentralised applications
- This is a great show by the way, it takes real skill to take a subject matter
  that dry and make it entertaining

## Recap of Session #03

???

- Before we begin the topics for this session, I'd like to do a quick recap of
  what we did in the previous session
- That was initially planned to be an introduction to Solidity, but we ran out
  of time during the session. Retrospectively, I would call the previous
  session "talking to Ethereum" instead.
- Some of you commented that the previous session was too slow paced, and Vedant
  had an excellent suggestion where he said why not have the ones who finish
  first help the others, so as to speed things up? So I guess you're going to

- First, we talked about the stack based execution model used by the EVM
- We took a simple arithmetic operation: 2 times 3 plus 4, and looked at how they would be represented in EVM bytecode, and then stepped through its execution, one stack operation at a time, advancing the program counter
- Of course it gets a lot more complicated than this, but that fundamentally illustrates how the EVM works at a low level

???

- Right now, we are learning about Solidity, but I thought it might be interesting to bring up a
  different programming language, Eiffel, because of the very interesting parallels that it has
  with smart contract programming in Ethereum
- This snippet of code that we have here on the screen features a class "ACCOUNT", with "deposit"
  and "withdraw" functions.
- Code syntax is very similar to Pascal, unlike Solidity, which is very similar to Javascript or C
- What is interesting here is that the designer of the language baked in a concept into the language
  spec called "design by contract", which allows the programmer to specify pre-conditions,
  post-conditions, and class invariants, and actually have this enforced by the compiler and
  at run time
- when programming smart contracts in ethereum, I think it is extremely helpful to keep the concept
  of "design by contract" in mind
- In previous sessions, some of you have asked me about what the phrase "smart contract" means, and
  many think it is about code to implement legal contracts, financial contracts, etc
  - Which is right, however, I think that "contract" in smart contract should *also* be viewed through
    the lens of Eiffel's definition of "Design by Contract", so I'd encourage you to have a read of that article!
  - especially in the context of function modifiers, require statements, etc

- We've already talked about the EVM byte code quite a bit in the previous sessions,
  but so far we haven't really talked about the ABI yet. In fact I've put off answering
  questions about the ABI twice so far - so now we'll actually get ot it.
- The ABI is needed for clients (think web apps), as well as other contracts, to invoke
  functions on the compiled contract.
- This is necessary because when you have a bit of compiled EVM bytecode, and you wish
  to call a function, which part of the byte code do you execute? Where do you place your
  program counter? That's what the ABI does, it specifies this mapping
- To go into a bit more detail - you cannot use the function names directly, because they
  do not exist within the compiled EVM bytecode, but instead are stored as the first 4
  bytes of the hash of the canonical function signature

- ABI is output as JSON

- `signature` is the Method ID

.footnote[
[ABI spec](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.5.7/abi-spec.html)
]
]

???

- So what's in the ABI is basically a mapping of all the method IDs for each of the
  function signatures, along with other metadata about the functions. For those who have
  done C programming before, you can think of this as a header file that is generated
  from the implementation automatically.
- A client who doesn't have the original solidity source code of the smart contract it
  is calling, or does not want to compile it itself, would need the ABI to be able
  to interact with the smart contract - other wise it is just trial and error
- We won't be going into the exact call semantics and how the client makes use of the ABI,
  so please read the ABI specification docs, which does a very thorough job of explaining this
- web3js - which we talked about in previous sessions, but will only go into detail in in
  session #06 - will be given this ABI and the address at which the smart contract is
  deployed, and then it will parse the ABI and know how to invoke functions at that address.
- At this point, that is what we really care about

- We've just tried out solc, the Solidity compiler. However, in order to develop
  DApps, we need a lot more than just the ability to compile. There is an entire
  set of tools that are necessary, and solc is just the first one.
- Tonight we'll be also talking about ganache and truffle, two other tools that
  we will be using
- In the previous session, we've talked about MetaMask, and in two sessions from
  now we will be covering web3.js in detail
- This is how all of these tools fit together, while you are developing
  - solc compiles solidity and produces byte code and ABI.
  - truffle is used to manage the running solc (you don't have to run the
    compiler yourself directly), manage deploying the compiled contract to the
    blockchain, and provide you with a REPL to interact with the deployed
    contracts directly.
  - ganache is a tool that provides you with a fuss free simulate blockchain on
    localhost.
- Note that this is not the *only* way to develop, there are indeed other ways,
  but this seems to be the most popular, or even default, preferred by solidity
  developers today

  hours -  so you'll be happy to learn that the set up for ganache is literally
  a few minutes long

- truffle is a smart contract development tool that can really be thought of
  as a collection of tools - a meta-tool if you will
- It manages the compilation and deployment of smart contracts. You don't need
  to run solc directly, neither do you need to send the compiled EVM byte code
  to the `0X00` address any more
- It also provides a test harness, which is essentially mocha wrapped with some
  smart contract stuff injected by truffle, which we'll get to in the next
  session.
- It also gives you a REPL, or a read-eval-print-loop, that allows you to
  interact with your smart contracts within your terminal
- It also interfaces with ganache realy well
- Note that depending on who you talk to, you might get rather varied opinions
  on whether truffle is suitable for use on the Ethereum main net. Many hold the
  opinion that it is not, and that you should only use it for localhost dev,
  or for localhost plus staging (test net) dev, but never for production
  (main net).

- So I met Alex at EthSingapore. He's the lead engineer at Authio, which does
  smart contract auditing and development
- His passion for education comes across immediately - he's running a school in
  Costa Rica to teach kids there about computers
- When I told him about what we're doing at DApps Dev Club, he immediately
  volunteered to help. In fact, we're likely to collaborate on more things than
  tonight's session, so watch this space.

- Our sessions in the DApps Dev Club are at the introductory level, aimed at
  complete beginners
- Tonight though, we'll be doing something different, temporarily, with Alex
  talking about some advanced aspects of smart contracts. He's going to:
  - Rip the covers off how Solidity works
  - Use inline assembly to motivate  more complicated data structures
  - What guarantees Solidity makes for dynamic types, and what it doesn't

- Read from Ethereum Book:
  - [Chapter 7](https://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook/blob/develop/07smart-contracts-solidity.asciidoc) - re-read
- Practice Javascript:
  - [scrimba](https://scrimba.com/g/gintrotojavascript)
  - [exercism.io](https://exercism.io/)
  - [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)
- Mocha:
  - [Getting started](https://mochajs.org/#getting-started)

- The topic that we are covering in our next session - testing smart contracts -
  does not have its own dedicated section in the Mastering Ethereum book.
  However, Chapter 7 is *still relevant*, as we will still be looking at
  Solidity. So re-read it if you have already, and read it if you haven't yet!
- The main thing that will be needed in the next session is some Javascript. In
  our DApps Dev Club sessions, we *do* teach Solidity from scratch, but we
  *will not** teach Javascript in the same way - you will need to know how to
  write some at a very basic level. But fret not, you can get up to speed
  extremely quickly, using the resources that you see on the screen.
  - In order of least time commitment to most: We have scrimba, exercism, and
    freeCodeCamp.
  - Scrimba is more of a basic introduction, exercism is set up as a
    "daily puzzle" type thing, and freeCodeCamp is a full-on course that goes
    from A-Z
  - If you don't have a lot of time to spare, just do the course on Scrimba
    that's linked here.
- Finally, there's one piece of software that you'll need to get acquainted
  with, and that is mocha, which is a framework for writing and running tests
  in Javascript
  - This is what we'll be using to test out smart contracts, so it might be
    worthwhile at least running through their getting started guide ahead of the next session, so that you are primed and ready to go

- Finally here's a list of all the tools that we will be making use of in the
  next session
- I've split them into tools which we have not encountered yet and needs to be
  installed, which is just Mocha
- &hellip; and tools which we should have already encountered, installed and
  used. If you have not got these working yet, please talk to me after the
  session, and I'll help you to troubleshoot.
