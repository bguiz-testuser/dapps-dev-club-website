# Decentralised Applications Development Club

![DApps Dev Club](https://dappsdev.org/img/dadc-logo.png)

## Intro to Solidity

26/03/2019

???

- The title for tonight's session is "Intro to solidity", but we'll be doing more than that
- In addition, we'll be getting your local set up (on your computers) ready for future sessions, to interact with the Ethereum network, and therefore DApps deployed to Ethereum

## Today

- [Partners](#partners)
- [Intro](#intro)
- [Recap Session #02](#recap)
- [Key Generation](#keygen)
- [MetaMask](#metamask)
- [Solidity](#solidity)
- [Games](#games)
- [Next session](#next)
- [Announcements](#next)

???

- This is the line up for tonight's session
- We'll start off by introducing our partners, and ourselves
- Then do a not-so-quick recap of the previous session
  - Not-so-quick, because as part of the recap, we're going to go into a little bit more detail about byte code, as that's going to set us up to understand what solidity is about later in the session
- But before we get into solidity, we're going to get you set up with some Ethereum Keys, and with MetaMask, so that you can finally talk to the Ethereum network
  - In the previous session, I asked you to install MetaMask, can I have a show of hands, who here managed to do that?
  - Who here tried to install MetaMask, but ran into some issues, or got stuck?
  - OK, so we'll make sure all of you here are properly set up tonight
- We'll then do the intro to solidity, and then try out some crypto zombies
- Finally we'll wrap with infomration about the next session, as well as some announcements

- Format inspired by the technical book club from SingaporeJS
- [dappsdev.org](https://dappsdev.org/)
- [our discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/eM9Vv7P)
]

???

- The DApps Dev Club meets twice a month, and this is our 2nd session
  - In each session, we plan to discuss about 3 or four different topics, selected from the *Mastering Ethereum* book
- We are a technical book club, so in each session, when we meet up together, we'll be discussing select parts from this book, plus working through things together
  - I should mention that while this is not a common format, it isn't completely new - in fact it is inspired by the book club that the SingaporeJS meetup runs
  - In the first couple of sessions, it was mostly me talking, but this session onwards will be a whole lot more hands on
- The nexus for all the club happennings are on this website, dappsdev.org
  - The main thing to look out for on the website are the news feed, which you can subscribe to via the RSS feed, or check back on manually
  - The other thing to look out for on the website is the sessions page, which is a calendar for all of the events
- Apart from meeting in person, we can also have discussions online
  - We have a discord server for that, and you can join using the link found on our website

- So, how about you? These sessions are designed with a particular audience in mind.
- If you know nothing about blockchain, or about smart contracts, that's perfect
- However, if you don't know some basic JS, you'll need to pick that up to follow along in the later sessions.
  - I'll post some resources that you can use to learn JS after this session, or come talk to me, or ask around in our discord
- Bring your laptops to the sessions, as you'll be able to paerticipate in the hands on parts of the sessions

???

- The EVM, executes op code/ byte code, which is similar to assembly language/ machine code
  - The point of the VM is that the same set of byte code can execute on any platform, and is an software abstraction layer over different hardware implementations
- It makes use of a stack-based execution model
- It also has this concept of **gas**, where each byte code has a particular cost associated with it.
  - When you execute something within the EVM, each instruction that is executed adds an this amount to a running total
  - When the invoker-specified limit for this running total is hit (or the global limit is reached), execution is aborted
  - For this reason, it is considered Turing complete, but not really, hence "quasi"
  - Finally, the invoker has to pay for the cost of this gas using Ether, which has a real cost
- We also looked at the EVM through the lens of distributed computation
  - Where many different computers compute the same tasks, as if it were a single computer
  - This achieves decentralisation, which is Ethereum's goal, but also entails more complexity
  - Thankfully this complexity is largely already taken care of, by using the a blockchain to achieve consensus
- So on this slide, one of the things mentioned was only very briefly mentioned in the previous session, and that is stack-based execution

- Demo time
- TODO find a way to make the graphic zoom upon load, or export as separate images and put them on one per slide
- Talk through each step
- Stop after the 3 pushes, and then ask if everyone is following so far
- Upon reaching the MUL, show the geth MUL implementation in the source again, and point out the stack operations within it

- The best way to learn what a stack based architecture is, is to actually implement one yourself
- Something with the simplest set of instructions will, such as add, subtract, multiply, and divide is perfect to get started with
- This link here is an interactive puzzle that let's you pick any programming language you like, and then build precisely that, and it has tests to make sure that you've got it going right
- Try this out yourself after the session!
- So that's the EVM

- Smart contracts are programs
- Usually written in Solidity (high level)
- Compiled into EVM byte code (low level)
- *Deployed* onto the blockchain
  - Code: Permanent
  - State: Can only be modified by itself

- We also talked about smart contracts in the previous session
- Both of our hands-on sessions from the previous session were smart contracts focussed
  - Tried out remix, by copy pasting a simple smart contract, and looking at the compiled output
  - Used a forked version of Anders' blockchain demo that showed how smart contracts encapsulated (code + state), and that this was stored on the blockchain itself
- Now this is the part that we are going to make our focus in tonight's session
  - We will be looking at writing our own smart contract using Solidity, instead of copy-pasting it

- BIPs are Bitcoin Improvement Proposals
  - Ethereum also has the equivalent: EIPs
- BIP39's actual title is "Mnemonic code for generating deterministic keys"
  - But it's more commonly known as the seed phrase wallet proposal
  - While this technique originated with the Bitcoin community, it doesn't really have much to do with Bitcoin itself, but rather cryptographic methods for generating asymmetric keys
  - So it works well with Ethereum, and many other cryptocurrencies too!
- This will also be a hands-on session for all of you. Be sure to follow along, as we will be generating a new wallet, which we will be making use of during the rest of the session.

- BIP44 is based upon yet another BIP - BIP32
- Now you *do not* need to know what all of these BIPs are, for DApp development, at least in a great level of detail.

- You can, of course, use them directly, with the protected key and the public key

- The process that we have used is not the most secure, and is good enough for demo and learning
- If you wish to use BIP39 and BIP44 to generate keys which you intend to use to store serious amounts of Ether, you should takes precautions to ensure that this information is not compromised
- MyEtherWallet has a wallet that's available at myetherwallet.com - but it also has a great guide on how to use the same wallet offline and locally on your computer
  - While these instructions are specific to MyEtherWallet, the general principles are applicable to any cryptocurrecny wallet
  - In the previous session one of you asked some questions regarding wallet security
    - The more securely you store something, the harder it is going to be to operate and use
  - Note that this will not be necessary for our sessions, but I would not feel right if I didn't at least mention this
    - For DApps, a lot of the time we only need to store small amounts of Ether in them, usually used to pay for gas fees

- So let's get set up with MetaMask within Chrome
- First up we're going to create a new profile within chrome, call it `dappsdev` or something similar
- Once we've got a profile, we'll install the extension from metamask.io
  - Beware that there are many impostor metamask extensions, so be sure to get it from the link on its website and nowhere else
- Hopefully you still have that seed phrase that we generated using Ian Coleman's site
- Click on "restore account", and then paste or type your seedphrase here

???

- You should notice that the address of the "Account 1" that was generated is the same as the first address in the table on the website
- Now click on the account avatar, and click on "+ Create Account"
- See "Account 2", which just got created. It's address should be the same as the second acount in the table.
- How does this work? It's because of BIP39, BIP44, and BIP32 - both Ian Coleman's website and MetaMask implement the same techniques
  - That's the point of having standards - different pieces of software are interoperable, and behave in a predictable way. That's a good thing!
  - More nuanced: Some of you may have noticed that you have told MetaMask about the seephrase, but have not input the BIP32 derivation path. That's because MetaMask simply uses the default BIP32 derivation path for Ethereum. Other wallet software allows you to specify a custom BIP32 derivation path

- In metamask, switch to the Ropsten test net
- Find a Ropsten faucet (just google it) and get some test net Ether, *or* join our discord, and copy your address from metamask and paste it in the `#sessions` room, and I will send you a small amount

???

- Here is the rough flow for working with solidity
- Firstly, you write the smart contract using Solidity
- Then you use `solc` which is the solidity compiler, to compile it
- This will output some EVM bytecode, and an ABI
- The ABI is the application binary interface, which is used by client in a DApp - but we aren't using this yet, not in this session
- The bytecode is what we are interested in now
- We sign a transaction to send a gas fee to a special zero address or null address (and pay for the gass fee, the amount being transferred is zero Ether)
- This bytecode is executed, and whatever state is left over after execution is the smart contract that is stored on the blockchain
- Once this happens the smart contract is considered to be deployed

- Before we talk about the next session, let's do a recap of what we've gone through today
  - We started off by talking about a bunch of BIPs which combined are used to generate cryptographic keys, in a standard way, such that various standards compliant Ethereum wallet software can use
  - We then installed one of these wallets, MetaMask, using the seed phrase we just generated
  - Then we used that wallet to interact with the ethereum wallet using the most basic possible DApp, to transfer Ether to each other on a testnet
    - There wasn't even any smart contract involved at this stage, just pure transactions!
- At this point we're all set up to interact with the Ethereum network, but we need solidity for smart contracts
