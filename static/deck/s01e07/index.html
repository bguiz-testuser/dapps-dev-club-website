# Decentralised Applications Development Club

![DApps Dev Club](https://dappsdev.org/img/dadc-logo.png)

## Smart Contract Security

28/05/2019

???

- In our previous session, ...
- In this session, ...
- As with previous sessions, ...
- Unlike the previous session, this one will be less focused on coding,
  and more focused on demonstrations.
  This is largely a result of the feedback from the previous session being that
  the difficulty level was too high, and also because of the nature of tonight's
  area - it has a huge surface area to be covered, and we'll only succeed
  within the time that we have for this session if we just do an introductory
  survey of each topic within the area.

### Already have these!

You should already have these from the previous sessions

- [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/)
- [solc](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.5.7/installing-solidity.html)
- [truffle](https://truffleframework.com/docs/truffle/getting-started/installation)
- [ganache](https://truffleframework.com/docs/ganache/quickstart)
- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/)

Note: Make sure you don't have Python 3 on your `PATH`

```bash
$ python --version
Python 3.6.5 :: Anaconda, Inc. # node-gyp may fail
```

???

- For this session, we don't really need to install anything,
  we'll be using Remix for the most part
- But here are all the stuff that we have already instaled in prior sessions,
  which you will need to install if you wish to follow along with the previous
  sessions, or need for future development

layout: false
class: left, middle, inverse

### Install these!

- [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) -
  `pip install slither-analyzer`
  - Note that you will need a Python 3 environment set up for this to work,
    which contradicts the requirement for `node-gyp` with Python 2 ðŸ˜¬
- [solidity-coverage](https://github.com/sc-forks/solidity-coverage) -
  `npm i -g solidity-coverage`
- Either:
  - get [ethernaut](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/ethernaut) running locally, *or*
  - get some Ropsten test net ether from a faucet
- Either
  - get [remix-ide](https://github.com/ethereum/remix-ide) -
    `npm i -g remix-ide` - running loclally, *or*
  - visit [remix.ethereum.org](https://remix.ethereum.org/)

- Decentralised Applications Development Club
- Format inspired by the technical book club from SingaporeJS

]

???

- The DApps Dev Club meets twice a month, and this is our 4th session
  - In each session, we plan to discuss about 3 or four different topics,
   selected from the *Mastering Ethereum* book
- We are a technical book club, so in each session, when we meet up together,
  we'll be discussing select parts from this book, plus working through things
  together
  - I should mention that while this is not a common format, it isn't completely
    new - in fact it is inspired by the book club that the SingaporeJS meetup
    runs
  - In the first couple of sessions, it was mostly me talking, but the rest of
    the sessions are going to be hands-on

- No blockchain knowledge required
- No solidity or smart contract knowledge required
- Basic Javascript needed in session #05
]

???

- So, how about you? These sessions are designed with a particular audience in
  mind.
- If you know nothing about blockchain, or about smart contracts, that's perfect
- However, if you don't know some basic JS, you'll need to pick that up to follow along in the later sessions.
  - I've already posted some resources that you can use to learn JS - it's in
    the latest post on dappsdev.org now,
    or come talk to me, or ask around in our discord
- Bring your laptops to the sessions, as you'll be able to participate in the
  hands on parts of the sessions

???

- I think most of us by now have encountered someone on a Telegram group, who
  joins, and within seconds says "wen ico? wen moon?" (with that exact spelling)
- If you're that person, these sessions are not for you. We're *not* going
  to be building an ERC20, or learning how to trade or speculate on them.
- What we're about here is focussed on developing decentralised applications
- This is a great show by the way, it takes real skill to take a subject matter
  that dry and make it entertaining
