How to accelerate learning as a developer

---
name: start
layout: false
class: middle, inverse

- structure: a series of ideas or tips
- style: **not** going to read text on slides
- questions: raise your hands and ask at any time
- speed: fast (want to maximise time afterwards)
- link: will post deck in chat after

???

- here's what you can expect in a nutshell

---
name: start
layout: false
class: middle, inverse

- üí°üí°üí°
- ‚ùì üôã (at any time)

???

- two things that I wanna call out:
- First is that questions are welcome at any time, you don't have to wait till the end.
- Second is: don't be worried if you can't take notes - the link to the deck will be shared in the chat group
- Let's begin

Thanks to everyone who has been asking questions, and adding tips!

## Manage a team of one
  
- Use Trello tickets/ post its on a wall/ etc
- Track your own learning progress
- You are your own manager

.footnote[
  [Trello](https://trello.com/)
]

???

- Let's start with who manages you
- Chances are that you will have a colleague who manages you, for example your boss, or your project manager
- You can also manage yourself - you don't need to only rely on your assigned manager to do it
- You can include your own "private" tasks such as learning into your plans
- To do this, Trello comes highly recommended as a tool to create, and arrange tasks. It's simple, unopinionated, and lets you get stuff done.

## Keep a weekly log

- Use for reflection/ consolidation
  - What did you accomplish this week?
  - What did you learn this week?
  - What questions do you still have from this week?
- This is not for taking notes!
- (daily if you wish + you can afford the time/ effort)

???

- This will allow you to track everything that you have done, which you'll probably forget as months so by.
- Pro-tip: When you're writing your resume, and you need a list of accomplishments, this will come in handy

---
layout: false
class: middle, inverse

## There are a ton of free resources

- Google `site:github.com "awesome-"`
- Look for **curated** resources
- Pick one and stick to it

???

- Make use of the free resources that are available
- The awesome dash something lists are pretty good at finding curated resources on a particular topic
- Don't go too far down a rabbit hole
- Find a resource that resonates

.width33percent[
  ![](./pick-one-and-stick-to-it.png)
]

???

- When you do pick something that resonates
- Then stick to it
- For how long? long enough that you get though the "initial pain"
- Only then reassess/ switch to something else
- What not to do: Jump all over the place and attempt to do many different things at once

---

class: middle, inverse

## Version control your learning

- Create git repos
  - Commit your notes as markdown fields
- If you don't want to learn in public, that's cool:
  - github now supports free private repos too
- Use this for any exercises/ tutorials too

.footnote[

- [Leitner Boxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leitner_system)
]

???

- If you want to remember something, you need to write it down.
- Do just that - so that you don't lose any of the things that you learn "on the job"
- As programmers, we have a great tool for that - which are version control systems, like git
- If you want to take this a step further, you can delve into the science behind memory and forgetting, as well as tools that help in this area
  - Links for these are in the footnotes
  - Summary: Whenever you learn something new, you are very likely to forget it unless you encounter it again soon.

## Don't overcommit

- Easy:
  Create a laundry list of all the things you want to learn
- Hard:
  put into practice
- So:
  Choose one
- Don't burn out!
  - Remember that you still have a job and other life commitments - 

???

- Committing and overcommitting
- Here's we're talking about all the other things that you want to learn "on the side", typically stuff that you don't need day to day, but you do aspire to learn.
- It's great that you have that hunger or eagerness to learn, but temper that with the reality of life, that like everyone else, you only have 24 hours in a day
- so don't burn out

.width50percent[
  ![](./jack-of-all-trades--1900.png)
]

???

- You may have heard the phrase: "Jack of all trades, master of none."
- It means if you try to be/ do too many things at once, you wind up not being very good at any one of them
- This applies to developers too - because there are so many different languages/ frameworks/ tools/ paradigms out there!

- Fun fact: There was actually a book published in the year 1900, titled "Jack of all trades" - that's where this picture was taken from

Image source: https://flic.kr/p/cobzMG - from "Jack of all Trades" published in 1900

## Practice over theory

- School: learn new skills, but don't apply them
- Job: apply new skills, but don't teach them
  - (DIY learning)
- Attempt to apply skills that you're about to learn, or have just learnt
- A great way to make sure you do this is to publicly commit to it
  - [#100DaysOfCode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/)

???

- The difference in how effective learning is with theory and practice will become apparent when you switch from schools to work
- Chances are that you'll retain things you'll learn on the job more than things you learn at school
- The flip side of that is: To learn things that **aren't** on the job, you should emulate how you learn on the job
  - Which is to do as you learn
- Additionally, if you're keen on making a public commitment to learning something - that helps as well
  - 100 days of code comes highly recommended

## Learn from colleagues

- Look at commits/ PRs, even ones that you aren't involved in
- Ask yourself why the tackled a particular problem in the way that they did
- Were there other ways to do the same thing?
- Ask them questions

???

- When you learn on the job, you'll be doing the bulk of the learning from those who are around you - your colleagues.
- These points here are some of the various ways to seek out and optimise this type of learning

---
layout: false
class: middle, inverse

## Look ahead, look behind

- Don't only learn what is currently relevant
- What has been around for more than five years?
- What do you think will be relevant in five years?

???

- Don't **just** learn what is currently relevant
- Hottest new frameworks are akin to pop music, in that they tend to stick around for a year, sometimes five, and then fizzle out
- What has been around for more than five years? Chances are that's sticking around.
- Sometimes it can also pay off to think about what will become relevant *in* five years time. There's a very good chance that you'll get this wrong, but it will be a big advantage if you're right. So hedge your bets.
- For stuff that has been around for a while, aim to learn best practices and execution.
- For stuff that you think will become the next big thing, aim to explore and attain a base level comprehension

## Alt. proof of skills

- Formal qualifications - what else?
- Certified by
  - online MOOCs (e.g. Coursera) or
  - professional certification bodies (e.g. AWS solutions architect)
- Portfolio

???

- Learning something new is great for personal development, but sometimes the benefits from that really only manifest when you are able to prove your knowledge
- You have options like diplomas, degrees, or even bootcamps
- There are alternate sources of certification too
- There's even a no-certification based approach, which is to create a portfolio of your work, which demonstrates your skills
- This can be quite powerful

---
layout: false
class: middle, inverse

## Teach

- Write
- Present to an audience

???

- What happens when you teach something?
  - You learn something - that's the input
  - Then you codify it - by reflecting upon it
  - Then you present what you have learnt - that's the output
- By doing so, this is obviously helpful to others, as you're imparting knowledge
- but also has a beneficial side effect for yourself
  - The act of writing/ explaining edifies your knowledge
