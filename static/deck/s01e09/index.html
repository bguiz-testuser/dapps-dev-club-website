### Already have these!

You should already have these from the previous sessions

- [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/)
- [solc](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.5.7/installing-solidity.html)
- [truffle](https://truffleframework.com/docs/truffle/getting-started/installation)
- [ganache](https://truffleframework.com/docs/ganache/quickstart)
- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/)
- [IPFS](https://docs.ipfs.io/guides/guides/install/)

Note: Make sure you don't have Python 3 on your `PATH`

```bash
$ python --version
Python 3.6.5 :: Anaconda, Inc. # node-gyp may fail
```

???

- For this session, we don't really need to install anything,
  we'll be using Remix for the most part
- But here are all the stuff that we have already installed in prior sessions,
  which you will need to install if you wish to follow along with the previous
  sessions, or need for future development

- For this session, our materials don't really come from the Ethereum book,
  because it is quite light on them - there is a very small section on IPFS
- There's also an alternative called Swarm, which the book goes into much more
  detail on, but it isn't as far along  as IPFS was
- The main reading material for tonight's session will be the IPFS documentation

- Decentralised Applications Development Club
- Format inspired by the technical book club from SingaporeJS

]

???

- The DApps Dev Club meets twice a month, and this is our 4th session
  - In each session, we plan to discuss about 3 or four different topics,
   selected from the *Mastering Ethereum* book
- We are a technical book club, so in each session, when we meet up together,
  we'll be discussing select parts from this book, plus working through things
  together
  - I should mention that while this is not a common format, it isn't completely
    new - in fact it is inspired by the book club that the SingaporeJS meetup
    runs
  - In the first couple of sessions, it was mostly me talking, but the rest of
    the sessions are going to be hands-on

- So, how about you? These sessions are designed with a particular audience in
  mind.
- If you know nothing about blockchain, or about smart contracts, that's perfect
- However, if you don't know some basic JS, you'll need to pick that up to follow along in the later sessions.
  - I've already posted some resources that you can use to learn JS - it's in
    the latest post on dappsdev.org now,
    or come talk to me, or ask around in our discord
- Bring your laptops to the sessions, as you'll be able to participate in the
  hands on parts of the sessions

  to be building an ERC20, or learning how to trade or speculate on them.

]

- Even better UX
  - Your Ethereum key-pair is also your encryption key-pair
- Much better to use specialised wallet software
  - **Don't** manage your keys within your client apps - note secure!
  - e.g. MetaMask stores your keys
- However, this means that wallet must support encryption
  - e.g. `web3.eth.encrypt(...)`
  - However, wallets have to wait for JSON-RPC to be standardised
  - Which means the EIPs must happen
- Until this happens, we're stuck with roll-your-own encryption

How about database-like behaviour?

- IPFS really just stores files
- What if we wanted to run SQL-like queries?
- One option:
  - `emit` events with indices
  - Query by index
  - Extremely limited
- Another option:
  - Use a two-step process, just like with our IPFS demo
  - Instead of writing to IPFS, and storing IPFS hash in smart contract
  - &hellip; write to a database (e.g. PostgreSQL), 
    and store hash of record in smart contract
  - Later on queries can be made against the database directly,
    and verifies using the hash in the smart contract
  - This introduces a degree of centralisation

Decentralised autonomous organisations

- When a smart contract is deployed, the default is to set
  and `owner` variable to `msg.sender` in its constructor
- &hellip; then restrict certain function calls to `owner` only
- However, this means that while the smart contract itself is 
  decentralised, its operations are still centralised
- What if `owner` was not a person but *another* smart contract?
- &hellip; and this `owner` smart contract was capable of 
  doing stuff based on votes (signatures) by 2 or more people?

How to support a large number of transactions per second?

- Ethereum itself is only designed to produce a block every 15 seconds
- For some apps, this is too slow
- One solution is to build a hybrid centralised and decentralised app
  - The high-volume transactions get offloaded from Ethereum
- There are various other apporaches
  - Side-chain based: e.g. Loom
  - State-channel based: e.g. Celer
  - Off-chain computation based: e.g. Oraclize

How do your resolve disputes?

- DApps do not necessarily only interact with data
- Just like CApps, they can often promise a certain good or service
  to be made available IRL
- When this happens, there is no way for a smart contract to
  instrinsically know about IRL occurrences
- Thus dispute resolution is necessary
- Simple means:
  - Hold payment in escrow
  - Abitrator appointed by smart contract can determine ruling
- More involved method:
  - Use a dispute resolution protocol
  - e.g. Kleros

### Recap

.right-column[

- Introduced Infura (we have been using it all along)
  - Without it you would need to run your own local Ethereum main net node
  - Introduces centralisation
- Introduced encryption and decryption
  - Blockchains **do not** give you privacy
  - Cryptography is currently used for: hashing, signing, &hellip;
  - &hellip; but not yet for encryption
  - Current limitations
- Back-end
  - There are a whole slew of things that back-end systems typically do
  - &hellip; but cannot do using smart contracts alone
  - Listed many alternatives/ projects that can you to do this

- The next session is called "beyond ethereum", 
  so by definition we will not be covering any new material from the "mastering ethereum book"
- So no reading "homework" this time!
- In lieu of that however, I would like all of you to take a look at some of your favourite
  projects out there, and come back to me about what you would like to get covered in season 2
  of DApps Dev Club
- There are a variety of different ways this could go
  - Continue with general-purpose Ethereum development
  - Focus of specific Ethereum stuff, for example specific ERCs or EIPs,
    or specific meta-projects built using Ethereum
  - ... or we could change track completely, and learn about general-purpose
    development on another network that supports the development of decentralised
    apps, that is not Ethereum at all!
- Please chime in on our group chat!
